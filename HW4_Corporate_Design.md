## 2. Logo and Brand Identity

### Logo Design
**FitTrack<span style="color: #FF6B35;">Pro</span>**

The logo consists of two distinct parts:
- **"FitTrack"** in deep blue (#004E89) representing reliability and professionalism
- **"Pro"** in vibrant orange (#FF6B35) representing energy and action

### Logo Characteristics
- **Typography:** Bold, modern sans-serif font (Segoe UI, weight 700)
- **Size:** 1.8rem (29px) for header display
- **Color Contrast:** The two-tone approach creates visual interest while maintaining readability
- **Symbolism:** The color split emphasizes both the professional aspect (tracking/management) and the energetic aspect (fitness/action)

### Branding Effect
The distinctive orange-blue combination creates immediate visual recognition. The split-color treatment is consistently applied across all brand touchpoints, making the brand memorable and easily identifiable even without the full logo text.
