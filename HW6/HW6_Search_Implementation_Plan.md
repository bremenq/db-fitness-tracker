**Live URL:** https://clabsql.clamv.constructor.university/~azinovev/forms/search_hub.html

## Implementation Strategy

Build search functionality using existing CGI infrastructure from HW5, adding 3 search queries (one per team member) with complete search forms, result lists, and detail pages.

## Team Assignment & Query Selection

### âœ… Aleksandr Zinovev - User Activity Search (COMPLETED)

**Query:** User types and workout activity analysis

**Implementation Status:** âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED**

**Files implemented:**

- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html` - Search form with filters (user type, date range, min users, calories, sorting)
- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/search_user_activity.py` - CGI script executing user hierarchy query (in root, not cgi-bin)
- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/user_detail.py` - Individual user detail page with workout history and progress tracking
- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_hub.html` - Main search landing page with all search categories

**Features implemented:**
- Search filters: user type (Individual/Gym Member/Staff), date range, minimum users, minimum avg calories
- Sorting options: user count, workout count, avg calories
- Results table with user type, total users, total workouts, avg calories
- "View Details" links to individual user pages
- User detail page shows: personal info, user type, gym membership (if applicable), staff details (if applicable), recent workouts, progress tracking
- Responsive design with Corporate Design styling
- Error handling and "no results" messages

**Example for other team members - See these files:**
1. **Search Form:** `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html`
   - Form structure with filters and validation
   - Action points to `../search_user_activity.py` (root directory, not cgi-bin)
   - Uses GET method for search parameters
   
2. **Search Results CGI:** `fittrack_cgi/search_user_activity.py`
   - Processes GET parameters from form
   - Builds dynamic SQL query with filters
   - Returns HTML table with results
   - Includes "View Details" links with user IDs
   
3. **Detail Page CGI:** `fittrack_cgi/user_detail.py`
   - Accepts `user_id` parameter from URL
   - Queries multiple tables for comprehensive user info
   - Shows related data (workouts, progress, memberships)
   - Includes navigation back to search results

**Database:** 28 users, 110 workouts available for testing

### âœ… Siwoo Lee - Gym Member Management Search (COMPLETED)

**Query:** Gym members with gym details and manager information

- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/search_exercise_performance.py` - CGI script executing exercise performance query
- âœ… `fittrack_cgi/exercise_detail.py` - Exercise detail page with performance stats, top performers, and recent activity

**Features:**
- Filter by category (Cardio/Strength/Flexibility/Balance), difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), muscle groups, and performance metrics
- Results table with exercise details, popularity metrics (total users/workouts), and average performance (sets/reps/weight)
- Detail page shows exercise info, instructions, equipment, performance statistics, top performers, and recent activity
- Complete exercise database with workout history available for testing

## Technical Implementation

### Search Form Structure

Each search form will include:

- Input fields matching query parameters (date ranges, dropdowns for categories)
- Corporate Design styling consistent with existing forms
- Form validation and user-friendly interface
- Action pointing to corresponding CGI search script

### CGI Search Scripts

Each search script will:

- Process form parameters and build dynamic SQL queries
- Execute queries against MariaDB database using existing connection pattern
- Return HTML results page or redirect to results display
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### Results List Pages

Each results page will:

- Display query results in formatted table/list
- Include clickable links to detail pages for each result item
- Show "No results found" message when appropriate
- Provide navigation back to search form

### Detail Pages

Each detail page will:

- Accept ID parameter and display single record details
- Show comprehensive information about selected item
- Include navigation back to results and search form
- Follow existing CGI pattern for database queries

## Integration Points

### Navigation Updates

- Add "Search" section to `fittrack_cgi/maintenance.html`
- Create search hub page linking to all 3 search forms
- Update navigation bar to include search functionality

### Database Queries

- Use existing queries from HW3 as foundation
- Adapt queries to accept search parameters
- Ensure proper SQL injection protection using parameterized queries

### Styling & Design

- Apply existing Corporate Design CSS from HW4/HW5
- Maintain consistent look with current forms
- Ensure responsive design for all new pages

## File Structure (Updated - CGI scripts in root, not cgi-bin)

```
fittrack_cgi/
â”œâ”€â”€ forms/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ search_hub.html                    # âœ… Main search page (DONE)

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search_exercise_performance.html   # âœ… Arslan's search form (DONE)
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ *.py (CGI scripts in root directory, NOT in cgi-bin/)
    â”œâ”€â”€ search_user_activity.py            # âœ… Aleksandr's search script (DONE)
    â”œâ”€â”€ user_detail.py                     # âœ… Aleksandr's detail page (DONE)
    â”œâ”€â”€ search_gym_members.py              # âœ… Lee's search script (DONE)
    â”œâ”€â”€ member_detail.py                   # âœ… Lee's detail page (DONE)
    â”œâ”€â”€ search_exercise_performance.py     # âœ… Arslan's search script (DONE)
    â””â”€â”€ exercise_detail.py                 # âœ… Arslan's detail page (DONE)
```

**Important:** All CGI scripts are in the `public_html` root directory, NOT in a `cgi-bin` subdirectory!
