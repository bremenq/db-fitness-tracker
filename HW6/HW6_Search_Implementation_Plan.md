# HW6 Search Component Implementation Plan

## Implementation Strategy

Build search functionality using existing CGI infrastructure from HW5, adding 3 search queries (one per team member) with complete search forms, result lists, and detail pages.

## Team Assignment & Query Selection

### ✅ Aleksandr Zinovev - User Activity Search (COMPLETED)

**Query:** User types and workout activity analysis

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND DEPLOYED**

**Files implemented:**

- ✅ `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html` - Search form with filters (user type, date range, min users, calories, sorting)
- ✅ `fittrack_cgi/search_user_activity.py` - CGI script executing user hierarchy query (in root, not cgi-bin)
- ✅ `fittrack_cgi/user_detail.py` - Individual user detail page with workout history and progress tracking
- ✅ `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_hub.html` - Main search landing page with all search categories

**Features implemented:**
- Search filters: user type (Individual/Gym Member/Staff), date range, minimum users, minimum avg calories
- Sorting options: user count, workout count, avg calories
- Results table with user type, total users, total workouts, avg calories
- "View Details" links to individual user pages
- User detail page shows: personal info, user type, gym membership (if applicable), staff details (if applicable), recent workouts, progress tracking
- Responsive design with Corporate Design styling
- Error handling and "no results" messages

**Example for other team members - See these files:**
1. **Search Form:** `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html`
   - Form structure with filters and validation
   - Action points to `../search_user_activity.py` (root directory, not cgi-bin)
   - Uses GET method for search parameters
   
2. **Search Results CGI:** `fittrack_cgi/search_user_activity.py`
   - Processes GET parameters from form
   - Builds dynamic SQL query with filters
   - Returns HTML table with results
   - Includes "View Details" links with user IDs
   
3. **Detail Page CGI:** `fittrack_cgi/user_detail.py`
   - Accepts `user_id` parameter from URL
   - Queries multiple tables for comprehensive user info
   - Shows related data (workouts, progress, memberships)
   - Includes navigation back to search results

**Database:** 28 users, 110 workouts available for testing

### 🚧 Siwoo Lee - Gym Member Management Search (IN PROGRESS)

**Query:** Gym members with gym details and manager information

**Implementation Status:** 🚧 **FORM CREATED, CGI PENDING**

**Files to implement:**

- 🚧 `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_gym_members.html` - Search form placeholder created
- ⏳ `fittrack_cgi/search_gym_members.py` - CGI script to implement (use Aleksandr's as example)
- ⏳ `fittrack_cgi/gym_member_detail.py` - Detail page to implement

**Suggested implementation (follow Aleksandr's pattern):**

1. **Search Form** - Update `search_gym_members.html` with:
   - Gym selection dropdown (load from database or hardcode)
   - Membership type filter (Basic/Premium)
   - Membership status filter (Active/Expired)
   - Date range for membership start/end
   - Form action: `action="../search_gym_members.py"` method="GET"

2. **Search Results CGI** - Create `search_gym_members.py`:
   - Query: Join `gym_member`, `user`, `gym`, `staff` (for manager)
   - Display: Member name, gym name, membership type, status, manager name
   - Include "View Details" link with `member_id` parameter
   - Reference: See `search_user_activity.py` for structure

3. **Detail Page CGI** - Create `gym_member_detail.py`:
   - Accept `member_id` parameter
   - Show: Full member info, gym details, membership history, class bookings
   - Reference: See `user_detail.py` for structure

**Database:** Use existing gym_member table with 1+ members

### 📋 Arslan Ahmet Berk - Exercise Performance Search (PLANNED)

**Query:** Exercise sessions and performance analytics

**Implementation Status:** 📋 **NOT STARTED**

**Files to implement:**

- ⏳ `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_exercise_performance.html` - Search form to create
- ⏳ `fittrack_cgi/search_exercise_performance.py` - CGI script to implement
- ⏳ `fittrack_cgi/exercise_detail.py` - Detail page to implement

**Suggested implementation (follow Aleksandr's pattern):**

1. **Search Form** - Create `search_exercise_performance.html`:
   - Exercise category filter (Cardio/Strength/Flexibility)
   - Difficulty filter (Easy/Medium/Hard)
   - Muscle group filter
   - Date range for workout sessions
   - Minimum session count filter
   - Form action: `action="../search_exercise_performance.py"` method="GET"

2. **Search Results CGI** - Create `search_exercise_performance.py`:
   - Query: Join `exercise`, `workout_exercise`, `workout`
   - Display: Exercise name, category, total sessions, avg duration, users count
   - Include "View Details" link with `exercise_id` parameter
   - Reference: See `search_user_activity.py` for structure

3. **Detail Page CGI** - Create `exercise_detail.py`:
   - Accept `exercise_id` parameter
   - Show: Exercise info, instructions, equipment, session history, performance stats
   - Reference: See `user_detail.py` for structure

**Database:** Use existing exercise and workout_exercise tables

## Technical Implementation

### Search Form Structure

Each search form will include:

- Input fields matching query parameters (date ranges, dropdowns for categories)
- Corporate Design styling consistent with existing forms
- Form validation and user-friendly interface
- Action pointing to corresponding CGI search script

### CGI Search Scripts

Each search script will:

- Process form parameters and build dynamic SQL queries
- Execute queries against MariaDB database using existing connection pattern
- Return HTML results page or redirect to results display
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### Results List Pages

Each results page will:

- Display query results in formatted table/list
- Include clickable links to detail pages for each result item
- Show "No results found" message when appropriate
- Provide navigation back to search form

### Detail Pages

Each detail page will:

- Accept ID parameter and display single record details
- Show comprehensive information about selected item
- Include navigation back to results and search form
- Follow existing CGI pattern for database queries

## Integration Points

### Navigation Updates

- Add "Search" section to `fittrack_cgi/maintenance.html`
- Create search hub page linking to all 3 search forms
- Update navigation bar to include search functionality

### Database Queries

- Use existing queries from HW3 as foundation
- Adapt queries to accept search parameters
- Ensure proper SQL injection protection using parameterized queries

### Styling & Design

- Apply existing Corporate Design CSS from HW4/HW5
- Maintain consistent look with current forms
- Ensure responsive design for all new pages

## File Structure (Updated - CGI scripts in root, not cgi-bin)

```
fittrack_cgi/
├── forms/
│   ├── search_hub.html                    # ✅ Main search page (DONE)
│   ├── search_user_activity.html          # ✅ Aleksandr's search form (DONE)
│   ├── search_gym_members.html            # 🚧 Lee's search form (PLACEHOLDER)
│   └── search_exercise_performance.html   # ⏳ Arslan's search form (TODO)
│
└── *.py (CGI scripts in root directory, NOT in cgi-bin/)
    ├── search_user_activity.py            # ✅ Aleksandr's search script (DONE)
    ├── user_detail.py                     # ✅ Aleksandr's detail page (DONE)
    ├── search_gym_members.py              # ⏳ Lee's search script (TODO)
    ├── gym_member_detail.py               # ⏳ Lee's detail page (TODO)
    ├── search_exercise_performance.py     # ⏳ Arslan's search script (TODO)
    └── exercise_detail.py                 # ⏳ Arslan's detail page (TODO)
```

**Important:** All CGI scripts are in the `public_html` root directory, NOT in a `cgi-bin` subdirectory!

---

**Deadline:** 2025-oct-30 23:59  
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS - Aleksandr's part complete, Lee and Arslan need to implement their searches  
**Next Step for Lee:** Implement `search_gym_members.py` and `gym_member_detail.py` (use Aleksandr's files as reference)  
**Next Step for Arslan:** Create search form, implement `search_exercise_performance.py` and `exercise_detail.py`

## Quick Start for Team Members

1. **Clone repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bremenq/db-fitness-tracker.git
   cd db-fitness-tracker
   git checkout HW6
   ```

2. **Study Aleksandr's implementation:**
   - Look at `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html` for form structure
   - Look at `fittrack_cgi/search_user_activity.py` for CGI script pattern
   - Look at `fittrack_cgi/user_detail.py` for detail page pattern

3. **Implement your search following the same pattern**

4. **Test locally, then deploy to ClamV server** (see `fittrack_cgi/DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
