# HW6 Search Component Implementation Plan

## Implementation Strategy

Build search functionality using existing CGI infrastructure from HW5, adding 3 search queries (one per team member) with complete search forms, result lists, and detail pages.

## Team Assignment & Query Selection

### Aleksandr Zinovev - User Activity Search

**Query:** User types and workout activity analysis

**Files to implement:**

- `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_user_activity.html` - Search form with date range, user type filters
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/search_user_activity.py` - CGI script executing user hierarchy query
- `fittrack_cgi/forms/user_activity_results.html` - Results list with links to detail pages
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/user_detail.py` - Individual user detail page

### Siwoo Lee - Gym Member Management Search  

**Query:** Gym members with gym details and manager information

**Files to implement:**

- `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_gym_members.html` - Search form with gym, membership type filters
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/search_gym_members.py` - CGI script executing staff hierarchy query
- `fittrack_cgi/forms/gym_member_results.html` - Results list with member details
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/gym_member_detail.py` - Individual member detail page

### Arslan Ahmet Berk - Exercise Performance Search

**Query:** Exercise sessions and performance analytics

**Files to implement:**

- `fittrack_cgi/forms/search_exercise_performance.html` - Search form with exercise type, date filters
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/search_exercise_performance.py` - CGI script executing exercise hierarchy query
- `fittrack_cgi/forms/exercise_performance_results.html` - Results list with performance metrics
- `fittrack_cgi/cgi-bin/exercise_detail.py` - Individual exercise detail page

## Technical Implementation

### Search Form Structure

Each search form will include:

- Input fields matching query parameters (date ranges, dropdowns for categories)
- Corporate Design styling consistent with existing forms
- Form validation and user-friendly interface
- Action pointing to corresponding CGI search script

### CGI Search Scripts

Each search script will:

- Process form parameters and build dynamic SQL queries
- Execute queries against MariaDB database using existing connection pattern
- Return HTML results page or redirect to results display
- Handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### Results List Pages

Each results page will:

- Display query results in formatted table/list
- Include clickable links to detail pages for each result item
- Show "No results found" message when appropriate
- Provide navigation back to search form

### Detail Pages

Each detail page will:

- Accept ID parameter and display single record details
- Show comprehensive information about selected item
- Include navigation back to results and search form
- Follow existing CGI pattern for database queries

## Integration Points

### Navigation Updates

- Add "Search" section to `fittrack_cgi/maintenance.html`
- Create search hub page linking to all 3 search forms
- Update navigation bar to include search functionality

### Database Queries

- Use existing queries from HW3 as foundation
- Adapt queries to accept search parameters
- Ensure proper SQL injection protection using parameterized queries

### Styling & Design

- Apply existing Corporate Design CSS from HW4/HW5
- Maintain consistent look with current forms
- Ensure responsive design for all new pages

## File Structure

│   ├── search_user_activity.html          # Aleksandr's search form
│   ├── search_gym_members.html            # Lee's search form

    ├── search_gym_members.py              # Lee's search script
    ├── search_exercise_performance.py     # Arslan's search script
    ├── user_detail.py                     # Aleksandr's detail page

    └── exercise_detail.py                 # Arslan's detail page
```

## Implementation Order

1. Create search hub page and update navigation
2. Implement Aleksandr's user activity search (most complex query)
3. Implement Lee's gym member search (moderate complexity)
4. Implement Arslan's exercise performance search (analytics focused)
5. Test all search functionality and fix integration issues
6. Update repository and deploy to server

## Assignment Requirements Compliance

### HW6 Requirements Met:
- ✅ **N queries for team size N** - 3 queries for 3 team members
- ✅ **Search forms** - Input attributes from HW3 query designs
- ✅ **Search result lists** - Display found elements with error handling
- ✅ **Detail result pages** - Single item presentation with links
- ✅ **Website accessibility** - Via Web browser in project directory
- ✅ **Git repository** - All code properly versioned

### Team Member Responsibilities:
- **Aleksandr Zinovev** - User activity search (complex analytics)
- **Siwoo Lee** - Gym member search (management focus)
- **Arslan Ahmet Berk** - Exercise performance search (metrics focus)

**Deadline:** 2025-oct-30 23:59  
**Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Next Step:** Begin with search hub creation and navigation updates
